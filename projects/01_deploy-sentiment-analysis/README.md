# Project 1: Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model

**Project Overview**

This project aims to:
1. deploy a model for predicting the sentiment of movie reviews developed using recurrent neural network (RNN) and PyTorch
2. create a web app which a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to the deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.
