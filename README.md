### Projects

| **Project** | **Title** | **Description** | **Technologies** | **Algorithms** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | [**Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model**](./projects/01_deploy-sentiment-analysis/README.md) | This project includes to (1) deploy a model for predicting the sentiment of movie reviews based on recurrent neural network (RNN); (2) creat a web app which will send movie reviews to the deployed model | SageMaker, PyTorch | |
| 2 | [**Plagiarism Detection**](./projects/02_plagiarism-detection/README.md) | This project aims to develop a plagiarism detector which classifies a text file as plagiarized or not | SageMaker | |
| 3 | [**Capstone Project**](./projects/03_capstone-project/README.md) | This project consists of developing a machine learning engineer project to deliver an end-to-end solution to a problem of personal choice | SageMaker | |

### Setup
The notebooks provided in this repository are intended to be executed using Amazon's SageMaker platform.
