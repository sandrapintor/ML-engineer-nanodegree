# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program

This repository collects the projects and code developed to complete the [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t) on Udacity.

### Projects

| **Project** | **Title** | **Description** | **AWS services used** | **Algorithms/Technologies** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | [**Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model**](./projects/01_sentiment-analysis/README.md) | This project includes to <br>(1) deploy a model for predicting the sentiment of movie reviews as positive or negative; <br>(2) create a web app which will send movie reviews to the deployed model | SageMaker,<br> Lambda function,<br> API Gateway | Long short-term memory (LSTM) <br> recurrent neural network (RNN) <br> using PyTorch |
| 2 | [**Deploy a Plagiarism Detector**](./projects/02_plagiarism-detection/README.md) | This project aims to develop and deploy a plagiarism detector which classifies a text file as plagiarized or not | SageMaker | Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) using `scikit-learn` |
| 3 | [**Capstone Project**](./projects/03_capstone-project/README.md) | This project consists of developing a machine learning engineer project to deliver an end-to-end solution to a problem of personal choice | SageMaker | |

### Setup
The notebooks provided in this repository are intended to be executed using Amazon's SageMaker platform.
